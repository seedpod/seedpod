				A big problem many initially enthusaistic gardeners face is remembering what they are supposed to do with their plants once they appear out of the soil. Books and websites always give a large range of dates when things might need to be done; but, because we know when you planted, we can tailor our advice specifically to you and your plants. Each month you'll get access to your personalised growing programme on our website that will tell you how to plant this month's seeds and how to care for the ones already growing. A taster of what you might receive can be seen <%= link_to "here", page_path("example") %>. As you can see, we keep it simple and to the point.
