  	<strong>How much space will I need?</strong> Our growing programme is perfect for small family gardens. If you don't have enough space to plant all the seeds each month, you can stagger your sowing to extend the cropping period. We will soon be adding smaller 'window-box' and larger 'allotment' options; please contact us if these would be of interest to you. 
</p>

  <p>	
  	<strong>Do I need a greenhouse or cold-frame?</strong> If you're lucky enough to have either, then great, but we understand that not everyone does. That's why we have designed as many of our seeds as possible to be sown straight into the ground. There may be occasions when you will need to sow indoors, but a propagator or seed tray placed against a warm window will suffice - and we will always advise you when this is the case.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>What equipment or tools will I need?</strong> We're not expecting you to go out and buy lots of equipment - we're keeping things simple. As a bare minimum you will need both a small and a large digging tool, such as a trowel and large garden fork. You will also need a seed tray or propagator (any high sided tray with holes in the bottom) for growing within a protected environment, some peat-free potting compost, and labels to help identify your plants.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What other things will I need to do once I join?</strong> You'll need to prepare your soil by ensuring it has been loosened, and that it contains plenty of organic matter. Starting your own compost heap will certainly help. 
</p>

  <p>
  	<strong>How many people will I be able to feed?</strong> The vegetable growing programme is intended to supplement the diet of a couple, or a small family, depending on the amount of growing space that is set aside. We are not suggesting that SeedPod alone will be able to feed a whole family, and there will certainly be occasions during the year when you have too much produce, and other times when you have too little. But through the clever use of storage and preserving techniques you should be able to enjoy your home-grown food all year round.

	<strong>When can I subscribe? Am I limited to joining at a certain time during each month?</strong> You can subscribe at any time during the month.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>How much is a monthly subscription?</strong> For only Â£6.00 each month (including VAT) you will receive two different types of herb or vegetable seeds. You will also have access to our timely guidance on how to sow, grow and crop your plants.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>What form of payment do you accept?</strong> We only accept payment by Direct Debit using GoCardless. They are a British company who specialise in providing secure methods of online payment.  
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Why don't you accept Debit/Credit Cards?</strong> SeedPod is a subscription service requiring a regular monthly payment, and Direct Debit is the simplest and most secure way of doing this. It's exactly the same Direct Debit as you use for paying your regular utility bills or mobile phone bill, except that it is administered by GoCardless. This means we don't have access to any of your bank account details. 
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Why do GoCardless require my bank account number and sort code? Usually when buying online I just need to provide 12 numbers on the front of my card!</strong> A Direct Debit is a system of authorising a regular transaction to be taken directly from a bank account. It means we don't need to keep on hassling you to authorise a payment on your card each month. But don't worry, you can cancel your Direct Debit whenever you like without any cancellation fee.  
</p>

<p>
	<strong>How much is delivery?</strong> Delivery is provided free of charge.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Can I get a VAT receipt?</strong> Certainly. Please send us an email and we will be happy to provide you with a VAT receipt. You should be aware that the vegetable seeds for which you are paying are subject to zero-rated VAT.

	<strong>How are the seeds delivered?</strong> We use 2nd class Royal Mail delivery to get your SeedPod straight through your letterbox. This means no 'sorry we missed you' cards, hiding a parcel behind a gate, or for you to head down to the depot to collect a missed delivery.  
</p>	

<p>
	<strong>Do you ship internationally?</strong> No, sorry, we only deliver to UK postal addresses, excluding the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
</p>

<p>	
    <strong>When will I receive the SeedPod?</strong> You can subscribe at any time, and will receive your first seeds no more than 10 days after subscribing. You will receive subsequent SeedPod deliveries on the same day each month (+/-2 days). Payment will only be deducted just prior to delivery during subsequent months.
</p>

<p>	
    <strong>Why does it take so long to receive my first SeedPod?</strong> We despatch your seeds once the first Direct Debit payment has been authorised by your bank. This process of making the first payment via Direct Debit can take slightly longer than payments by debit card or credit card. You can follow how quickly this process takes by signing into your GoCardless account.

	<strong>Are the seeds organic?</strong> Our seeds have been specially selected to be easily grown, and to maximise the amount of produce, therfore not all our seeds are organic. Where possible, they remain untreated. We will be adding the option for an exclusively organic vegetable seed subscription very soon indeed. 
</p>

<p>
	<strong>What vegetable varieties will I receive over the course of the year?</strong> Our growing programme has been designed to ensure you are able to sow and grow throughout the year. The typical range of seeds you might receive includes: beetroot, broad beans, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, chives, courgette, cucumber, french beans, leeks, onions, pak choi, parsnip, peas, rocket, runner beans, spinach, squash, sweetcorn, tomatoes, turnip, winter lettuce, chilli, winter radish. Actual vegetable seeds included in monthly SeedPods may vary according to availability.

	<strong>Can seeds be planted straight into normal soil?</strong> You will greatly improve your vegetables by keeping your soil in good condition. This means thoroughly digging and turning your soil prior to sowing, and ideally adding plenty of organic matter such as soil improver or compost.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>How should I store my excess seeds that haven't been sown?</strong> If you find yourself with too many seeds, most can be kept for sowing the following weeks. By staggering your sowing you can stagger (and extend) the cropping period. Make sure you store spare seeds somewhere cool, dark and dry to keep them dormant.

	<strong>How much of the packaging can be recycled?</strong> All of our packaging is 100% recyclable, even the outer envelope is padded with shredded paper and can be popped into your paper recycling bin. Better yet, tear it up and add it to your compost.

	<strong>What are food miles?</strong> This is the distance that items of food have travelled in order to reach your plate from wherever it was produced. Home growing your own food means you can reduce the amount of energy used to transport food around the globe, thereby reducing the harmful impact upon the environment.
