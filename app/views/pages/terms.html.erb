<strong>Payments and Deliveries</strong>
</p>

<p>
	All quoted prices are inclusive of VAT. You should be aware that the vegetable seeds for which you are paying are subject to zero-rated VAT.
</p>

<p>
	All indivudual subscriptions are managed securely by GoCardless. For details of their terms and conditions please visit their <a href="https://gocardless.com/legal/customers">website</a>.
</p>

<p>
	All gift subscriptions are managed securely by PayPal. For details on their terms and conditions please visit their <a href="https://cms.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/UserAgreement_full">website</a>.
</p>

<p>
	When you pay for an individual subscription on SeedPod a monthly payment will be taken by GoCardless via direct debit. The direct debit usually takes 8-14 days to be authorised by your bank. Upon confirmation of your first payment by the bank, the first delivery of vegetable seeds will be despatched. 
</p>

<p>
	Your seeds will be despatched approximately the same day each month as your first delivery (+/- 2 days), at which time you will gain access to your online guidance for that month.
</p>

<p>
	Delivery is provided with our monthly subscriptions at no additional cost to you.
</p>

<p>
	We only despatch to postal addresses in the United Kingdom, excluding the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
</p>

<p>
	If your order is damaged or lost during transit we will send a replacement as soon as we can, at no additional cost to you.
</p> 

<p>
	<strong>Gift Subscriptions</strong>
</p>

<p>
	An account created using a gift code will close after the duration of the gift subscription has expired - either 3, 6, 9, or 12 months after the gift code is initially used - unless the account holder uses an additional gift code, or establishes a new direct debit for the account.
</p>

<p>
Gift codes cannot be redeemed within one week of purchase.
</p>

<p>
	Each gift codes is one-time use only.
</p>
	
<p>
	<strong>Refunds, Returns, and Cancelling your Subscription</strong>
</p>

<p>
	If you are unhappy with your SeedPod deivery for any reason, and wish to receive a refund, you must inform us within 7 days of receipt. All seed packets must be returned unopened. A full refund will be issued within 30 days. This applies to individual subscriptions only, and does not apply for Gift Subscriptions (see below).
</p>

<p>
	Any request for a refund will not result in the automatic cancellation of your subscription. You will therefore continue to make payments for, and to receive, subsequent SeedPod deliveries.
</p>

<p>
	We are a subscription service, with no contractual tie-in â€“ you can cancel at any time without penalty and we won't take the following month's payment. Subscriptions may be cancelled within your Account Settings.
</p> 
	
<p>
	Cancelling your subscription with SeedPod, or deleting your SeedPod account, will not result in the deletion of your GoCardless account. This would need to be completed independently.
</p>

<p>
	Growing guidance is only accessible whilst a subscription remains active. The cancellation of a SeedPod subscription will result in loss of access to all growing guidance, including for seeds that have already been sown in previous months.
</p>
	 
<p>
	Refunds for gift subscriptions must be made within 30 days of purchase, and prior to the appropriate gift code being used. Refunds for gift subscriptions will not be made after a gift code has been used by a recipient of the code.
