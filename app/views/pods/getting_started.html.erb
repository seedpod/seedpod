	Welcome to SeedPod! We'll be sending out your first pod shortly, so it should be with you in the next 10 days. You'll receive an email once your seeds are on their way, which will also link to your personalised growing guidance.

<p>
	In the mean time, here are a few things you could do to prepare your growing space, to give you a head start. None of this is essential, but should make your growing experience easier and help produce healthier plants.  
</p>
<p><strong>For the Garden</strong></p>
<p>
	<li><%= image_tag 'fork.jpg', class: "img-responsive pull-right", width:"300" %><b>Prepare your soil</b>: make sure whenever you are sowing or planting directly into garden soil that it's been loosened with a garden fork or spade - this is a must in order to give your baby plants a chance to make it to daylight. Adding organic matter (either a soil improver or compost from your local garden centre, or even your own garden compost) would be ideal. Improving the condition of your soil will ensure it contains sufficient nutrients for your plants. It will also improve moisture retention. You'll be amazed at the difference this will make.</li>
	<li><b>Start your own compost heap</b>: We'll provide more detail on this later, but in simple terms start collecting your vegetative matter (e.g. grass cuttings and vegetable scraps) as well as shredded paper from your unwanted mail. Mix them up in as large a container as possible, and keep it moist. </li>
	<li><%= image_tag 'compost.jpg', class: "img-responsive pull-left", width:"300" %><b>Tools</b>: As a bare minimum you will need both a small and a large digging tool, such as a trowel and large garden fork. You will also need a seed tray or propagator (any high sided tray with holes in the bottom) for growing within a protected environment, some peat-free seed or potting compost (or your own garden compost as described above!) and labels to help identify your plants. </li>
	<li><b>Enough space to grow</b>: If you'd like, you could build some fancy raised beds, but it really isn't necessary. Remember, we're keeping this simple. By all means clear away some space in an unloved flower bed, or dig up a patch of lawn in the corner of the garden. However, even that isn't really necessary - your veggies will live happily around other plants and don't need a dedicated plot. But wherever you do happen to choose, you will need to prepare the soil as described above, ensure your plants are sheltered from strong winds, and have access to sunlight. </li>
</p>
<p><strong>For the Balcony or Courtyard</strong></p>
<p>If you can do any of the above, then great, but we realise lots of people live in flats or apartments, and don't have the space for a compost heap or raised beds. But if you only have access to a balcony or small area for pots, there's actually far less to do which makes growing even more simple.
