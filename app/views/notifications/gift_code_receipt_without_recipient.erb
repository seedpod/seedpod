	Hi <%= @purchaser_name %>
</p> 
<p>
	Thank you for purchasing a <%= @months %> month SeedPod gift subscription for <%= @price%>.
</p>

<p>
Your unique gift code to be used when creating an account on the <a href='http://www.getseedpod.com/users/sign_up'>SeedPod</a> website is "<strong><%= @code %></strong>". All the details of your gift subscription are below, and can either be printed and cut out for inclusion in a card, or if you prefer you could forward the bottom half of this email. You could even treat yourself and use the code on your own account (we won't tell anyone!). Once an account is setup, the first delivery of vegetable seeds will soon follow, as will access to the fantastic growing guidance.
</p>

<p>
	 We know they're going to be chuffed to bits! But if you do have any queries about the gift you've purchased, please get in touch with us at <a href='mailto:greetings@getseedpod.com'>greetings@getseedpod.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Thank you once again!
</p>

<p>Best wishes,
	the SeedPod team</p>
