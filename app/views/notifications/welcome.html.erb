<p><%= @greeting %> welcome to SeedPod!</p>

<p>
	Thank you for joining us. You're now a part of an amazing community of growers who, like you, want to get the most from their vegetable plants, but without the hassle of remembering what to do and when.
</p>

<p>
	We will despatch your first pod as soon as the first payment of your direct debit is cleared by your bank. Which means you'll receive your first pod, some chilli peppers and some cucumber, between 8 and 14 calendar days from now. You'll also gain access to the accompanying guidance on our website at the same time - but don't worry as we'll let you know as soon as your pod has been shipped.
</p>
	
<p>
	We have a fantastic growing schedule lined up for the months ahead, which we're sure you'll love.
</p>

<p>We know we're going to have a lot of fun growing together.</p>

<p>Best wishes,
	the SeedPod team</p>
