<p><%= @greeting %> welcome to SeedPod!</p>

<p>
	Thank you for joining us. You're now a part of an amazing community of growers who, like you, want to get the most from their vegetable plants, but without the hassle of remembering what to do and when.
</p>

<p>
  We will despatch your first pod 
	<% if @gift_code %>
    immediately,
  <% else %>
    as soon as the first payment of your direct debit is cleared by your bank,
  <% end %>
  which means you'll receive your first pod between
	<% if @gift_code %>
    2 and 6
  <% else %>
    8 and 14
  <% end %>
  calendar days from now. You'll also gain access to the accompanying guidance on our website at the same time - but don't worry as we'll let you know as soon as your pod has been shipped.
</p>
	
<p>
	We have a fantastic growing schedule lined up for the months ahead, which we're sure you'll love.
</p>

<p>We know we're going to have a lot of fun growing together.</p>

<p>Best wishes,
	the SeedPod team</p>
