<p>This month's SeedPod is now on its way to you! Soon you'll receive Dwarf French Bean seeds, and Parsnips too if you are a 'garden' subscriber. Everything you need to help you sow and grow can be found in your <a href="http://www.getseedpod.com/pods/this_month">February growing guidance</a>.</p> 

<p>The snow may be falling but spring is on its way, so let's get growing and get a head start.</p> 
	
<p>We're sure you'll love your seasonal packet of seeds and advice.
