<p><%= @greeting %></p>

<p>This month's SeedPod is now on its way to you! Soon you'll receive Runner Beans and Beet Leaf seeds (or just Runner Beans if you're a 'balcony' subscriber). Everything you need to help you sow and grow can be found in your <a href="http://www.getseedpod.com/pods/this_month">July growing guidance</a>.</p> 
	
<p>You may notice we've changed the design on the back of the seed packets to include sowing instructions - we hope you'll find this really handy when you're in the garden, and not online. Do please let us know your thoughts on this new design and whether it's useful. If you have any other ideas, feedback, photos or questions, you can get in touch via our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getseedpod">Facebook</a> page and on <a href="https://twitter.com/SeedPod">Twitter</a>. 
</p>
<p>One other change we're introducing this month is the option to request more seeds. If you would like something a little extra just drop us a line and we'd be more than happy to send you one additional packet, at no extra charge, whilst this month's stocks last. We can't guarantee we'll have anything available - but there's no harm asking!
</p>
	
<p>Happy growing!<br/>
