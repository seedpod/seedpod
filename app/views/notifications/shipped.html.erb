<p>This month's SeedPod is now on its way to you! Soon you'll receive Radishes and Turnip seeds (or just Radishes if you're a 'balcony' subscriber). Everything you need to help you sow and grow can be found in your <a href="http://www.getseedpod.com/pods/this_month">August growing guidance</a>.</p> 
	
<p>Remember to let us know if run out of seeds and would like to grow some more. Just drop us a line and we'll send you one additional packet, at no extra charge, whilst this month's stocks last. We can't guarantee we'll have anything available - but there's no harm asking!
</p>

<p>You'll see that we're still tweaking and improving the way we present information on our seed packets so everything you need to know is in the palm of your hand. We hope this will make your growing experience even simpler! If you have any other ideas, feedback, photos or questions, you can get in touch via our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getseedpod">Facebook</a> page and on <a href="https://twitter.com/SeedPod">Twitter</a>. 
</p>

	
<p>Happy growing!<br/>
	from the SeedPod team</p>
