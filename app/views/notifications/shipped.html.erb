<p>This month's SeedPod is now on its way to you! Soon you'll receive Waltham Butternut Squash and Carrot seeds (or just the Squash seeds if you're a 'balcony' subscriber). Everything you need to help you sow and grow can be found in your <a href="http://www.getseedpod.com/pods/this_month">June growing guidance</a>. 
	
We love to hear how you're getting along with all your plants.

<p>With the approach of Father's Day, why not send a SeedPod gift subscription to encourage someone you love to get into the garden? We offer a range of prices to suit all budgets. You can even save up to 15% over an individual monthly subscription. All the details can be found <a href="http://www.getseedpod.com/gift_codes/new">here</a>.
