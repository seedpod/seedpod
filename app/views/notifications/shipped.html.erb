<p>This month's SeedPod is now on its way to you! To help you as the seasons change we're sending you seeds to grow peas over the winter, and we're also sending you some lovely lettuce as well.</p>
<p>You also now have access to the <a href="http://www.getseedpod.com/pods/this_month">October growing guidance</a>. It's your handy guide to sowing your seeds, caring for your plants as they grow and, later in the year, advising you when to harvest. Remember to let everyone know how you're getting on by posting photos and questions on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getseedpod">Facebook</a> page and on <a href="https://twitter.com/SeedPod">Twitter</a>!

<p>Best wishes,<br/>
	the SeedPod team</p>
