<p>This month's SeedPod is now on its way to you! Soon you'll receive Hot Pepper and Beetroot (or just Hot Pepper if you're a 'balcony' subscriber). Everything you need to help you sow and grow can be found in your <a href="http://www.getseedpod.com/pods/this_month">January growing guidance</a>.</p> 

<p>It may be getting rather nippy outdoors, but there's still plenty of enjoyment to be had out in the garden at this time of year. You can also continue to grow indoors, which is what we'll be doing this month.</p> 
	
<p>We're sure you'll love your seasonal packet of seeds and advice. But if you have any questions or feedback for us, you can email us at greetings@getseedpod.com or in touch with us via our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getseedpod">Facebook</a> page or on <a href="https://twitter.com/SeedPod">Twitter</a>.
