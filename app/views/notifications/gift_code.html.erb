<p>Hi <%= @recipient_name %>,</p>

<p>Your gift means you will be sent two different varieties of vegetable seeds each month, as well as gaining access to a unique guided growing programme to help you sow the seeds, and to nurture the plants. We even help you harvest the veg at the right time. 
</p>

<p>
	It's as simple as that. In fact everything about SeedPod has been designed to be simple, as you'll discover when you see the fantastic growing schedule lined up for the months ahead. So don't wait, jump right in, and get growing!
